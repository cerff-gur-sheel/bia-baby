## 📱 Running on Android

To test the app on an Android environment:

- You can use an **Android emulator**, a **physical device** with **developer mode** enabled, or **[Waydroid](https://waydro.id/)** if you are using Linux.

- For **Waydroid**, make sure it is running. Then, with the Metro bundler running (`yarn start`), use:`` 
yarn android
``

> ⚠️ **Note:** The command `yarn start --android` may **not work properly with Waydroid**.  
> In this case, copy the link shown in the terminal (something like `exp://<your-ip>:19000`) and manually paste it into **Expo Go** inside Waydroid.  
> Make sure Waydroid has internet access and is on the **same network** as the host.
